        <p>
            The core values of which Jitesoft operates are in essence quite simple.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A well and context appropriate behaviour is expected.</li>
            <li>Zero tolerance of sexism, racism and other form of discrimination.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our FOSS project <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1726742" target="_blank">guidelines</a> is currently an
            adoption of the Contributor Covenant with minor additions.
